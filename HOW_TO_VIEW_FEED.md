# How to View Your Podman Community Feed

## The feed exists in your account but may not be searchable yet

Since you created the feed, it's automatically in your account. Here's how to access it:

## Method 1: Direct Link (Easiest)

Go directly to your feed page:
```
https://bsky.app/profile/actionmancan.bsky.social/feed/3m5p5ammzgh2s
```

## Method 2: View from Your Profile

1. Open Bluesky app or go to https://bsky.app
2. Go to **your profile** (@actionmancan.bsky.social)
3. Click the **"Feeds"** tab
4. You should see **"Podman Community"** listed
5. Click on it to view
6. Click the **pin icon** to add it to your main feeds

## Method 3: Share Link

Once you can see the feed, you can share it with others using:
- The direct link above
- Or the AT URI: `at://did:plc:oe2nzi6rjpijm5o2w2gp7jzo/feed/3m5p5ammzgh2s`

## Why Search Doesn't Work Yet

Bluesky's feed search/discovery:
- Takes time to index new feeds
- May require the feed to have some activity first
- Might not show feeds with zero posts yet

## Next Steps

1. **Access the feed directly** using the link above
2. **Pin it** to your feeds so it appears in your feed list
3. **Share the link** with the Podman community
4. Wait for it to populate with Podman-related posts

The feed generator is working - it just needs to be accessed directly rather than through search.
